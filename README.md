--Practical Applications of this Work:
1. Digitized medical records 
2. Automated Form Processing using OCR (Optimal Character Recognition) 
3. Bank Cheque processing
4. License Plate Recognition
5. Exam Automation using OMR (Optimal Mark Recognition)

--ML Models Applied:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers are used for comparison to assess the overall effectiveness of various approaches for digit recognition.
